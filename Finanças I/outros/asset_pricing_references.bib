	title = {Asset {Pricing} at the {Millennium}},
	abstract = {This paper surveys the field of asset pricing. The emphasis is on the interplay between theory and empirical work and on the trade-off between risk and return. Modern research seeks to understand the behavior of the stochastic discount factor (SDF) that prices all assets in the economy. The behavior of the term structure of real interest rates restricts the conditional mean of the SDF, whereas patterns of risk premia restrict its conditional volatility and factor structure. Stylized facts about interest rates, aggregate stock prices, and cross-sectional patterns in stock returns have stimulated new research on optimal portfolio choice, intertemporal equilibrium models, and behavioral finance.},

	abstract = {Discount-rate variation is the central organizing question of current asset-pricing research. I survey facts, theories, and applications. Previously, we thought returns were unpredictable, with variation in price-dividend ratios due to variation in expected cashﬂows. Now it seems all price-dividend variation corresponds to discount-rate variation. We also thought that the cross-section of expected returns came from the CAPM. Now we have a zoo of new factors. I categorize discount-rate theories based on central ingredients and data sources. Incorporating discount-rate variation affects ﬁnance applications, including portfolio theory, accounting, cost of capital, capital structure, compensation, and macroeconomics.},

	title = {Empirical properties of asset returns: stylized facts and statistical issues},
	abstract = {We present a set of stylized empirical facts emerging from the statistical analysis of price variations in various types of ﬁnancial markets. We ﬁrst discuss some general issues common to all statistical studies of ﬁnancial time series. Various statistical properties of asset returns are then described: distributional properties, tail properties and extreme ﬂuctuations, pathwise regularity, linear and nonlinear dependence of returns in time and across stocks. Our description emphasizes properties common to a wide variety of markets and instruments. We then show how these statistical properties invalidate many of the common statistical approaches used to study ﬁnancial data sets and examine some of the statistical problems encountered in each case.},
